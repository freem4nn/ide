### Sublime text

My text editor of choice due to the fact that it has a very small load on your workstation.

### Final thoughts

 **1. When working with a laptop make sure your ide does not take all of your memory.**
 **2. Sublime is my ide of choice because it does not slow down my system (laptop)**
 **3. When working with a desktop workstation i would choose visual studio due to its multi functionality**
