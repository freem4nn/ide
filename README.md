what ide's to use

Visual Studio
---

Multifunctional and a free editor.
Feels a bit bloated at times but it has an overal good functionality, 
working with almost all comercial language's 

---
Sublime text
---

My text editor of choice due to the fact that it has a very small load on your workstation.
It stays maintained,
almost no noticable difference between the paid version and the free verison.

----
WebStorm
---

Clean and very responsive editor, at first glance seeming a bit complicated, but as times progresses becoming clear and easy to use
