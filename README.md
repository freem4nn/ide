Multi functional and  free editor.
Feels a bit bloated at times but it has an overall good functionality, 
working with almost all commercial language's know to

### Sublime text
---
My text editor of choice due to the fact that it has a very small load on your workstation.
It stays maintained,
almost no noticeable difference between the paid version and the free version.

### Final thoughts

 

 1. When working with a laptop make sure your ide does not take all of your memory.
 2. Sublime is my ide of choice because it does not slow down my system (laptop)
 3. When working with a desktop workstation i would choose visual studio due to its multi functionality
